# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

Hello there! I'm Ali, a Computer Engineering student at the Turkish Aeronautical Association University. I've been passionate about software development for almost three years, working on various projects and gaining experience in different programming languages.

## About Me

- 🎓 Studying Computer Engineering at [Turkish Aeronautical Association University](https://www.thk.edu.tr/en/)

## Projects

### Discord Bot - Alisa
I've developed a Discord bot using `discord.js` to streamline server management. The bot is free to use and runs continuously without interruptions. If you'd like to add it to your server, feel free to [click here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=838446728230993930&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands%20bot).

### NPM Modules
I've also shared some modules on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/~pordarman). While these modules may seem simple, I wanted to contribute to the community by sharing my work.

## Learning Journey

Currently, I'm diving into the world of C++ as I embark on a game development project this summer. It's an exciting learning experience, and I'm eager to enhance my skills in this versatile programming language.

## Other Projects
I also have various modules and tools in the following projects:

## Current Project
I'm currently working on developing an Instagram-style platform on Discord. With this bot, you can share posts, like them, comment, and follow other users. Please note that the project is still in the testing phase, so there might be minor bugs. Your understanding is appreciated. You can invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=838446728230993930&permissions=414464723969&scope=applications.commands%20bot).

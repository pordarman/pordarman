I'm a passionate developer and a Computer Engineering student at the University of Turkish Aeronautical Association.  
I love building user-centric applications, learning new technologies, and contributing to the community.  
Currently, I'm challenging myself by developing a 2D game with **C#** and **Unity**!

🚀 My Projects

### 🎮 2D Pixel Platformer Game

My most exciting project at the moment, which I'm actively developing! I'm building a 2D platformer game from scratch using C# and the Unity game engine. Through this project, I'm learning game development dynamics and taking my C# skills to the next level.

**Technologies Used:** C#, Unity

### 🤖 Discord Bot - Alisa (Inactive)

A Discord bot developed with `discord.js` to streamline server management. This project was one of my first major steps into Node.js and API integration. The bot is currently inactive for maintenance, but you can still check out the code.

**Technologies Used:** JavaScript, Node.js, discord.js
